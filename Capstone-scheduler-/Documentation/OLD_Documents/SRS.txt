INTRODUCTION

	The essence of the project is a web application that displays
room availabilities and allows users to reserve those rooms for a
specific time slot. Below in this document the goal is to understand
and document the requirements of the system, make sure they are 
feasible and consistent with each other. The purpose and scope are
written; the description of constraints and assumptions of the project 
are noted. In the specific requirements section the functional and 
nonfunctional requirements are documented. A use case model and 
domain model is present; from which use cases are derived. 
Critical use cases are identified, the respective system sequence 
diagrams are shown, with the system operations, the operation 
contracts followed the interaction diagrams. 


Purpose

	The srs is a contract between developers and stackholders; 
given such it is meant to be read by both stackholders and developers 
and validate all requiments. The structure is such that we decribe 
what is feasable and the constraints we have on the system. Following 
that the requiments for the system are detailed, both functinal and 
nonfunctional. Thano use case models, use cases and the domain model. 
The use cases tell us a story of how our system behaves. 
Stackholder can verify these "stories" upon reading if it matches 
their requriments. 


Scope

The project allows a user to log into the webpage. A schedule 
appears wiht a list of rooms; the user can view the scheduele for 
different rooms and see avaliable timeslots. The user can thus book 
a timeslot for a room or if desired timeslot is taken can go on the 
waitlist. The goals essentialy is to allow users find a room that 
is free and book a timeslot, and should it all be taken go on the waitlist. 
This will allow students to organize meetings with far more ease.

OVERALL DESCRIPTION
This section describes a background to the requirements: 
The general factors that affect the product, such as 
constraints, assumptions and dependencies.


Product perspective
	The product is available to all concordia engineering students. 
It is a web based application that uses layered architecture + client 
server architecture. It works among all the major browsers. User account, 
the system allows the user to login to their accounts in the system 
and provide features of updating and viewing their reservations. The 
system can support a small to medium number of users as it is hosted off a computer. 


Product functions
	The major system functions provided by the product to a user 
include making a new reservation for an available room at a desired 
timeslot, entering the waiting list for a booked room at a desired 
timeslot, deleting an existing room reservation, modifying an 
existing reservation, and viewing their current reservations. 

* User characteristics
	The intended users of this product are students studying 
in the Engineering department of Concordia University. The user 
is not expected to have a particularly high level of experience 
or technical expertise in software systems, they are merely are 
expected to be at a University educational level. 


Constraints
	The system must promote fairness by limiting the number of 
reservations a given user can occupy at a time. The system must 
also incorporate a level of safety and security, by ensuring a 
user’s credentials and information cannot be accessed by other 
users of the system, and also that a user’s information, such 
as their current reservations or waiting list status, cannot 
be overwritten by another user. If two or more users make a 
reservation for an available room simultaneously, the system 
must award the reservation to one user, and provide an error 
message to the other user(s). 


Assumptions and dependencies
	As a web application, the system’s main dependency will be 
a web browser. It is assumed that the system will be compatible 
with all major operating systems (Windows, Linux and macOS). It 
is expected to be compatible with all modern browsers that respect 
HTML5 web standards. It assumes that rooms will be available for 
reservation on any day of the week, including weekends, with 
the exception of holidays recognized by the University.



SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 
This section contains all requirements in detail: Functional as 
well as non-functional requirements (quality attributes and constraints). 
The quality attributes are listed according to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard 
that classifies software quality in a structured set of characteristics and sub-characteristics.


External interfaces
1-	Input: Username and Password (login credentials)
	Output: Error message if the user isn’t found in the database


2-	Input: Make room reservation (Day, Time slot, Room number)
	Output: Success message if reservation was made, error message if not.


3-	Input: Room Number
	Output: Weekly Calendar showing the room information (time slot statuses)


4-	Input: Modify room reservation (Room Number, Old Time Slot, New Time Slot)
Output: Success message if modification is successful, error message if not.


5-	Input: Cancel room reservation (Day, Time Slot, Room Number)
Output: Success message if cancellation is successful, error message if not.
